To check whether **MongoDB is installed** on your **Mac**, follow these steps:

---

### ‚úÖ Method 1: Check via Terminal

1. **Open Terminal** (You can use Spotlight with `Cmd + Space`, then type ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù and press Enter).

2. **Run this command**:

   ```bash
   mongod --version
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   mongo --version
   ```

3. **Check the Output**:

   * If MongoDB is installed, you'll see something like:

     ```
     db version v7.0.3
     Build Info: ...
     ```

   * If it's **not installed**, you'll see an error like:

     ```
     zsh: command not found: mongod
     ```

### ‚úÖ Method 2: Check with `brew` (Homebrew Installation)

If you used [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install MongoDB, you can check it with:

```bash
brew list | grep mongo
```

If installed, it will list packages like:

```
mongodb-community
mongodb-database-tools
```

If nothing appears, it‚Äôs likely not installed via Homebrew.

---

### üõ† If Not Installed: Quick Installation with Homebrew

To install MongoDB using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
```

After installation, you can start MongoDB with:

```bash
brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
```
