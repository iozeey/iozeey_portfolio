To check which account is being used to push to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Check Git Global Configuration:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to see the global username and email configuration in Git:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name
   git config --global user.email
   ```

   This will display the global Git username and email that are set for commits.

2. **Check Local Repository Configuration:**
   If you want to check the Git username and email specific to a particular repository, navigate to that repository and run:

   ```bash
   git config user.name
   git config user.email
   ```

   This will show the username and email configured for the current repository. If these values are not set, Git will use the global settings.

3. **Check Git Remote URL:**
   You can also check the remote URL to confirm which account you're pushing to, by running:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   The URL displayed might contain the GitHub username (if you're using HTTPS) or be in the format `git@github.com:username/repository.git` (for SSH).

4. **Check Authentication (for HTTPS):**
   When pushing via HTTPS, Git will ask for your username and password (or personal access token) the first time. You can check your saved credentials in your Git credential manager:

   * On macOS, check **Keychain Access**.
   * On Windows, check **Credential Manager**.
   * On Linux, it might be stored in `~/.git-credentials`.

5. **Check SSH Keys (for SSH):**
   If you're using SSH, check the SSH keys associated with your GitHub account. Run the following command to see which SSH key is being used:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   GitHub will respond with the username associated with the SSH key.

This will help you identify which GitHub account is being used to push your changes.
