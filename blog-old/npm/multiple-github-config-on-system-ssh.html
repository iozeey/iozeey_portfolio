To push to your new GitHub account from your local MacBook, you'll need to manage multiple GitHub accounts on the same machine. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting it up:

### 1. **Set up SSH keys for the new account:**

You should generate a new SSH key for the new GitHub account. This will allow you to authenticate using SSH when pushing to the new repository.

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key for your new GitHub account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email-for-new-account@example.com"
```

When prompted, save the key to a different location (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa_new_account`).

### 2. **Add the new SSH key to GitHub:**

Add the SSH key to the new GitHub account:

1. Copy the public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new_account.pub
   ```
2. Go to **GitHub** > **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Click **New SSH key** and paste the key there.

### 3. **Update the SSH config file:**

You'll need to configure SSH to use different keys for different GitHub accounts. Edit (or create) the SSH config file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following lines to specify which key to use for GitHub:

```bash
# Default GitHub Account
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# New GitHub Account
Host github-new
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new_account
```

### 4. **Clone or modify the repository:**

If you’re pushing to a new repository, you can clone it using the new GitHub account:

```bash
git clone git@github-new:username/new-repository.git
```

If the repository already exists locally, you can change the remote URL to use the new SSH configuration:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github-new:username/new-repository.git
```

### 5. **Set your new Git user credentials (Optional):**

If you want to ensure your commits are associated with the new GitHub account, set the local repository's user details:

```bash
git config user.name "New Account Name"
git config user.email "your-email-for-new-account@example.com"
```

### 6. **Push to the new GitHub account:**

Now you can push to the new repository:

```bash
git push origin master
```

By following these steps, you should be able to push to your new GitHub account from your local machine while keeping the old account intact.

The issue you're encountering happens because the SSH fingerprint is not recognized when connecting to GitHub, which can happen when switching between multiple accounts or different SSH keys. It's not necessarily an issue with the fingerprint for each account but rather how SSH manages known hosts.

To resolve this and ensure that both accounts work smoothly, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clear the Old Fingerprint:**

GitHub's SSH fingerprints for the same host (github.com) may be stored in the `known_hosts` file. When you use a new account, the SSH client will encounter the previous key and warn you.

To clear the old fingerprint from the `known_hosts` file:

```bash
# Open the known_hosts file in a text editor
nano ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

Search for the line that contains `github.com` and delete it.

Alternatively, you can use this command to remove the old entry:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R github.com
```

This will remove the old GitHub fingerprint from your `known_hosts` file.

### 2. **Reconnect and Accept the New Fingerprint:**

Once you’ve removed the old fingerprint, reconnect using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github-new:rashidsadiq1991/npm-package.git
```

When prompted about the authenticity of the host, you should see the correct GitHub fingerprint for your new account. Type `yes` to add the new fingerprint to your `known_hosts` file.

You can confirm the fingerprint is correct by checking GitHub’s SSH key fingerprints here: [GitHub SSH Key Fingerprints](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints).

After accepting, the SSH client will remember the fingerprint and you shouldn't encounter this warning again.

### 3. **Ensure the SSH Configuration is Correct:**

Make sure your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) is correctly set up to distinguish between both accounts. You should have something like this:

```bash
# Default GitHub Account
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# New GitHub Account
Host github-new
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new_account
```

This ensures the right SSH key is used for each GitHub account.

### 4. **Verify the New SSH Key:**

To double-check that your SSH setup is working for the new account, run:

```bash
ssh -T git@github-new
```

It should confirm a successful authentication with your new GitHub account, showing a message like:

```bash
Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

With these steps, you should be able to successfully push and pull to repositories using different GitHub accounts without any issues related to SSH fingerprints.
