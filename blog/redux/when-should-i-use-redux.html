        <h1>When to Use Redux</h1>
        <p>Redux is a state management library commonly used with React applications. It helps manage the application
            state in a predictable way. Here are some scenarios where using Redux is beneficial:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complex State Logic</strong>: When the application state has complex logic, such as multiple
                nested states or dependencies between state variables, Redux can help by organizing and managing these
                states in a single store.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Components Sharing State</strong>: If multiple components need to access and update the
                same state, Redux provides a centralized store that all components can subscribe to and dispatch actions
                to update the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictable State Management</strong>: Redux enforces strict rules for how the state can be
                updated, which helps in making the state predictable. This is particularly useful in large applications
                where state management can become difficult to trace and debug.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging and Logging</strong>: Redux provides tools like Redux DevTools that allow developers
                to track state changes over time, making it easier to debug and understand state transitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</strong>: For applications that need server-side rendering, managing
                state on the server and rehydrating it on the client can be streamlined using Redux.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency Across Environments</strong>: If an application needs to maintain consistent state
                management across different environments (e.g., client-side, server-side, testing), Redux provides a
                uniform approach to handling state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, Redux might not be necessary for all projects. Consider the following before deciding to use Redux:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small or Simple Applications</strong>: For small applications or those with simple state needs,
                React's built-in state management (using <code>useState</code> or <code>useReducer</code>) might be
                sufficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Component State</strong>: If the state is mostly local to individual components and
                doesn't need to be shared across many components, using local component state is simpler and involves
                less boilerplate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, use Redux when your application has complex state management requirements, needs to share state
            across many components, or would benefit from advanced debugging and state consistency tools. For simpler
            applications, native React state management might be more appropriate.</p>
