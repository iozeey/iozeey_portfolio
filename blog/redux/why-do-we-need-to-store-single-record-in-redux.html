        <h1>Why Store a Single Record in Redux?</h1>
        <p>Storing a single record in Redux can be beneficial for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Centralizing the state in Redux ensures that all components access the same data source. This prevents discrepancies that could arise from using different state instances.</li>
            <li><strong>Ease of Access</strong>: Having a single record in Redux makes it easily accessible from any component in the application without needing to pass it down through props, simplifying data flow and component hierarchy.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictability</strong>: Redux enforces a strict structure on how the state is updated through actions and reducers. This makes the state changes predictable and easier to debug, even when dealing with a single record.</li>
            <li><strong>State Management Tools</strong>: Redux comes with powerful tools like Redux DevTools, which allow for time-travel debugging, viewing state changes, and recording state history. These tools can be invaluable even when managing a single record.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Even if the current requirement is to manage a single record, using Redux sets up a scalable structure. As the application grows, adding more state management functionality becomes straightforward without needing to refactor existing code.</li>
        </ul>
