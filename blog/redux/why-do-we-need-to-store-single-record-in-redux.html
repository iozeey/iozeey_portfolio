        <h1>Why do we need to store single record in redux?</h1>
        <p>
            Storing a single record or a piece of data in Redux is not always necessary or even practical. Redux is
            typically used for managing the state of an entire application or a significant portion of it. It's designed
            to centralize and manage the state that multiple components throughout your application might need to access
            and modify.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there can be scenarios where you might want to store a single record in Redux. Here are a few
            possible reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Global Access: </strong> If you have a piece of data that many different components across your
            application need to
            access, it can be convenient to store it in Redux. This avoids the need to pass the data as props through a
            deep component hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Consistency: </strong> Storing a single record in Redux ensures that all components that need
            access to that data are
            working with the same source of truth. Any changes made to that record are reflected consistently throughout
            your application.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> State Management: </strong> If the single record needs to be updated or modified by different parts
            of your
            application, using Redux can help manage state changes, ensuring that updates are controlled and
            predictable.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Middleware and Actions: </strong> If you want to perform specific actions or side effects when the
            data changes,
            Redux's middleware system provides a structured way to do this. For example, you might want to log changes,
            trigger network requests, or update other parts of the application in response to changes in this single
            record.
        </p>

        <p>Storing a single record in Redux can be beneficial for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Centralizing the state in Redux ensures that all components access the
                same data source. This prevents discrepancies that could arise from using different state instances.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ease of Access</strong>: Having a single record in Redux makes it easily accessible from any
                component in the application without needing to pass it down through props, simplifying data flow and
                component hierarchy.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictability</strong>: Redux enforces a strict structure on how the state is updated through
                actions and reducers. This makes the state changes predictable and easier to debug, even when dealing
                with a single record.</li>
            <li><strong>State Management Tools</strong>: Redux comes with powerful tools like Redux DevTools, which
                allow for time-travel debugging, viewing state changes, and recording state history. These tools can be
                invaluable even when managing a single record.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Even if the current requirement is to manage a single record, using Redux
                sets up a scalable structure. As the application grows, adding more state management functionality
                becomes straightforward without needing to refactor existing code.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            However, it's essential to consider whether using Redux for a single record is the right choice for your
            specific use case. If the data is truly local and only needed within a specific component, it might be
            overkill to use Redux, and you could manage the state within the component's own state instead. Redux is
            most beneficial when you have complex state management needs that involve multiple components and actions
            across your application.
